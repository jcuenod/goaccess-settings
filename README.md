# Description

## Systemd Timer/Service

The `analytics.timer` and `analytics.service` files should be located in:

- `/etc/systemd/user/analytics.timer`
- `/etc/systemd/user/analytics.service`

To start the service (which runs hourlyâ€”this can be changed by editing the `OnCalendar` variable in the `analytics.timer` file):

```
systemctl --user start analytics.service
```

The `analytics.service` has an output path in the `ExecStart` variable. I point that to a path whose files are served statically so that I can look up recent analytics on my server (e.g. `/var/www/`).

## GoAccess Settings

The service executes goaccess, which draws its settings from `~/.goaccessrc`. The file is not complicated but a number of settings are worth paying attention to especially the last section entitled "Independently Added". Also, look for settings about the geolite mmdb database.
